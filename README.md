# Express-Learn

This repository serves as a learning project created during college to explore and understand the core functionalities of Express.js, a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework.

## About the Project
The purpose of this project was to gain hands-on experience with building web applications using Express.js. It includes basic implementations of routing, middleware, and API development, providing a strong foundation for future projects.

## Features
- Basic routing and request handling.
- Middleware integration for request processing.
- Static file serving.
- API creation with JSON responses.

## Technologies Used
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment.
- **Express.js**: Framework for building web applications.
- **JavaScript**: Programming language used for application logic.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your system.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
